<h3>Cookie and Tracking Technology</h3>
e-ELECTION and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you, with the exception of IP addresses. IP addresses are combined with other information we collect about you in the e-ELECTION platform to provide an audit trail.
Our website also includes Social Media Features, such as the Share This button. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
We partner with a third party to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising click here. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Distribution of Information</h3>
We will share your personally identifiable information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. In certain situations, e-ELECTION may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, enforce our website policies, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
We may provide your personally identifiable information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as processing payments. These companies are authorized to use your personally identifiable information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
If e-ELECTION is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Commitment to Data Security</h3>
Your personally identifiable information is kept secure. Only authorized employees, agents and contractors (who have agreed to keep information secure and confidential) have access to this information.
All sensitive payment information (credit card number, expiry date, validation code) is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then transmitted to our payment gateway provider. The payment gateway provider's database is only accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and they are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your sensitive payment information will not be stored on our servers.
All elector authentication credentials (elector ID, password), vote information and vote receipts are encrypted via Secure Socket Layer as well. When a remote authentication method is used (web service, LDAP) the elector credentials are then transmitted to the remote authentication server and will not be stored on our servers.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us.
