We will credit your account 5% of your election fee for each 30 minutes of unavailability, up to 100% of your election fee. Election fee is defined as your Annual Plan fee or most recent Single Election fee, whichever applies. Credits shall not be provided to you if unavailability is the result of: a) special maintenance b) circumstances beyond e-ELECTION's reasonable control, including, but not limited to: dDOS or other network attacks, upstream or 3rd party network outages, war, fire, flood, sabotage, labour disturbance, acts of government, acts of god or c) your breach of this Agreement.
