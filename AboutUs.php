E-election was born out of years of frustration running elections for the organizations we volunteer with, using computer scripts written over many years by many different people.
We knew we could do better.E-election is designed and developed. We do our best to build simple elegant technology solutions to real world problems by listening to our customer needs. And <strong>we are always looking to be better!</strong> So feel free to email us with any question or comments or improvements!
